## Spirit Stone Generation
As a disciple's cultivation level improves, they generate spirit stones that can be used for various in-game functionalities. The rate of spirit stone generation increases progressively with each level in their respective realms, reflecting their cultivation expertise.

- Each level contributes an increasing amount of spirit stones based on cultivation:
  - Level 1: 1 stone
  - Level 2: 2 stones
  - Level 3: 4 stones
  - Level 4: 8 stones
  - Level 5: 16 stones
  - Level 6: 32 stones
  - Level 7: 64 stones
  - Level 8: 128 stones
  - Level 9: 256 stones

This structure ensures that players have a clear understanding of their progression and the goals they need to achieve to advance.
